								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>We are facing a digital world. We are consistently bombed with thousands and millions of information everyday. It is important to evaluate data, analyze information and apply data information to real word in all walks of life. In the future, there is no doubt that information technology is a key factor. I first interested in IT when I decide to apply Master degree of business and marketing. Information is always the first step to start with in any disciplines, especially the time of the digital world has arrived. I believe that the combination of IT and marketing and psychology can help me to better develop technical and creative skills in my career prospect.</p>
								<p>Additionally, I decide to study in RMIT because RMIT focuses more on practical ability. Its graduate employment rate is at the top among other Australian universities. More importantly, RMIT has a very tolerant attitude towards diversity cultures. People here are really kind and passionate. </p>
<p>I expect to learn how to collect, recognize and analyze data in IT. It can practice my logical thinking and rational thought. During my learning experience in psychology, I am equipped with the skill of critical thinking. It would be a great mix of combing logical and critical thinking which can benefit my further study, even my career. </p>

								<p>My idea job is Management Consulting in McKinsey & Company. Management consulting is specialized to assess company, identify problem, gather information and implement solutions. There are different branches of Management consulting, for example, strategy, human resources, risk, finance and so on. Being a management consultant, I can always work on different teams for different clients. Working with different people can learn from them and introduce diversity into life which is interesting and exciting. </p>
<p>According to job advertisement, the qualification of being a consultant is high-demanding. The basic and rigid requirement is that employee has to complete undergraduate degree with three years relative working experience or master degree. Secondly, talented analytic ability is required. It requires people to be proficient in analyzing data and information. Thirdly, problem-solving skills are also expected in consulting. Fourthly, consultants always work in a group. Therefore, it requires employee has the ability to adapt new environment rapidly and fit in the group very well. Moreover, collaborative and communicative skills play an important role in developing consulting which makes the work more effective. </p>
<p>During my undergraduate of Psychology, I have the ability of being adaptive in a new environment and conservable with people. I can accurately and clearly express my idea. Studying Psychology practice my problem-solving skills. I can think critically and independently. So far, I did some researches by applying scientific and statistical methods during my learning experiences. Therefore, I have skills of searching information, collective data and analyzing data. </p>
<p>However, I still have a long way to go before I become a constant. I should finish my master degree firstly. Most importantly, I should be expert with analytics. Therefore, I decide to take Information Technology as an elective course which can enhance my ability of dealing with data. Secondly, I am required to improve my capacity of leadership. I plan to join in more group work which can also boost my communicative skills. </p>							</article>

<p>According to my Myers-Briggs test, I am a mostly introverted person. I avoid to be around people. And I always feel exhausted and embarrassed with social interaction. I also get a high score in observant which means that I live in present. I focus more on what is happening now. More importantly, I pay more attention on surroundings, and it makes me more practical. Additionally, the results show that I am emotional. When I am making decision, I always follow my heart even without realizing it. Moreover, high score in identity presents that I am assertive. I am able to work under pressure. </p>
<p>Based on the results of learning style, it presents that I am a visual learner. I preferred to learning and memorizing things by sight. When I learn new knowledges, I always draw a picture in my head which can help me to remember it. Therefore, if I recall things, the relative picture first come into my head. </p>
<p>According to my Big 5 Questionnaire report, I got a low score on Extroversion which is similar to the result of first test. I think it perfectly described me. I am quiet in a group discussion and feel anxiety if people pay attention to me. </p>
<p>Being an observant and an assertive person can make benefits at work. It makes me highly practical and effective in the complex working environment. When I am facing the much pressure from work, I can stay calm and think logically to deal with problems. I believe these characteristics can perfectly satisfied with the requirement of management consulting, as it is a competitive workplace. However, being introverted is difficult to fit in the collaborative group. During taking online courses, I intentionally take part in discussion and communicate my perspectives with others in order to foster participant in course. It is gratifying to see as a weakness that I have made some efforts to share my personal views in discussion, and I would like to double down on growth. I have seen some progress while it remains a challenge and look forward to continuous improvement. </p>

									<h3 class="Overview">Overview</h3>
									<p>Campus Search APP is a third-party platform (IOS platform, Android platform), for college students, aggregating information around the university, food, clothing, housing and transportation, classification and centralized release, convenient for college students to study and live application software. It is the same as Yiyi.com, Dazhongdianping and other life service APP software in Australia: both are to serve consumers, both provide information for consumers, convenient for consumers to query. What is different from other service APPs is that Campus Search APP targets college students and subdivides the consumers, while all the contents released by APP are combined with students' life experience, and then released after being collected and screened by special data collectors. </p>
<h3 class="Motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>As world's Internet user base grows larger and larger, the Internet industry is playing an important role in the market economy. At the same time, the advent of the information age has completely changed people's traditional means of communication. From sending letters to making phone calls, from making phone calls to talking online phones, from talking cell phones to smart phones that can access large amounts of information, the main means of people's access to information has undergone a qualitative change. People are not only satisfied with the function of talking and texting, but also use cell phones as a tool for receiving information, understanding current affairs, establishing social networks, facilitating life and playing games. The acceptance and reliance of college students on various information platforms are generally very strong, but there are a lot of mixed applications of life services on the market, and there are few applications that provide information to facilitate the study life of college students with the basic starting point of the interests of college students. So the campus search APP for college students is born. </p>

<h3 class="Description">Description</h3>
<p>Campus APP is a smart phone application for students in specific schools, which aims to provide localized learning and living information and certain social functions for students, its functions include: campus information, information query, living services, local dating and other aspects, which can not only provide various convenient services for college students in life, learning and entertainment, but also provide a good opportunity for our college students to start their own business. It also provides a good opportunity for students to start their own business. </p>
<p> The services of APP provide: </p>
<p> 1.	map and navigation around the campus: marking the location around the school (such as cafes, gyms), while supporting the sharing of locations between users. </p>
<p> 2.	Store reviews in and around campus: star ratings for each store in the surrounding area, initial ratings with reference to other review APPs, continuous updates from users, support for store collections and sharing.  </p>
<p> 3.	Class schedule and classroom guide function: the APP includes the time and classroom location of the class, and also provides a detailed classroom location plan, with the classroom highlighted. Provide the function of alarm clock before class, which can be set independently to remind how long before class. </p>
<p> 4.	Campus information push function: real-time information on each campus network, classification of information and setting of tags, users can pay attention to each tag, the information of the tags that users pay attention to will be pushed in real time (including all kinds of notices, results release time, news, lecture information, etc.). </p>
<p> 5.	Life information push function: pushing information on merchants' special offers, and constantly updated product information such as cinemas, etc. in a similar tagging manner. </p>
<p> APP part is divided into two versions for ios system and Android system, the interface design is guided by a simple and clear style, divided into three parts: user, function and software feedback. </p>
<p> User part is the part where users manage their accounts and personal information, supporting default (i.e. visitor login), including information management of accounts, management of tag groups, management of custom tags, setting of push information, saving of class schedule information, and management of collection information. </p>
<p> Function part is the part of software function implementation, including the association with Google Maps to provide navigation, the association with software such as Instagram to provide sharing of information such as addresses or stores, the association with alarm clocks for reminders, the information push system, and the system for networking to obtain store information, and the system for implementing user and software feedback.
Software feedback is the part where the software is set up and where the user contacts the software designer. It includes the basic settings of the software (login and logout, whether to push messages, version updates, etc.), feedback (submitting comments and ideas in text form), and business contact (campus activities that need to be promoted are contacted through this channel with a dedicated person). </p>
<p> There is also a corresponding APP background management system, which is responsible for managing the uploaded store information and various timely updated push messages. At the same time, it records various information such as users' search records for future upgrades and improvements. </p>

<h3 class="Tools and technologies">Tools and technologies</h3>
<p>Use JAVA to create Android version, and use the iOS-specific SDK released by Apple to create the iOS version. As the APP market is full of pirated software, APP users are very likely to download pirated software unintentionally and suffer losses from pirated APPs in the process of using them, at which time, uninformed APP users may wrongly point the finger at the operator or developer of the genuine APP. 
<p> The ways to deal with this risk are usually: </p>
<p> 1. Prompt users to download the APP through official channels in a prominent position on the APP developer's website, and avoid downloading through unofficial channels such as third-party APP markets and forums. </p>
<p> 2. You can add a program in APP to prompt users to verify whether it is a genuine APP when it is launched for the first time. </p>
<p> 3. Provide users with a way to verify the genuine APP through technical means (such as MD5 code verification, etc.). </p>
<p> 4. Use in the website user agreement and APP user agreement for users. </p>

<h3 class="Skills required">Skills required</h3>
<p> 1.	APP UI: The designer carries out the design of the prototype according to the requirements, including the structural distribution of functions, the design of the sub-pages and the design of the business logic between pages. </p>
<p>2.Server side: writing the interface protocol documentation, setting up the server environment (Amazon), designing the database and writing the API interface. </p>
<p> 3.APP side: developing interface according to UI design drawings, entering and interfacing with the server-side interface, obtaining data through the server-side interface and writing functional logic code. </p>
<p>4.Web management side: according to the front-end business logic, the back-end will have the corresponding function to match it, need to write the logic code on the function. </p>
<p> 5.Testing and debugging: After the app function is developed, the testers will systematically test the whole project. </p>

<h3 class="Outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p> With the rapid popularity of smartphones, smartphone-based mobile APPs have been developed rapidly in recent years. Compared with the general commercial APPs, smartphone APPs for college students have their own characteristics. Different kinds of APPs have their own designed application functions and also have the properties of media to a certain extent, therefore, they can be classified as new media. There are no accurate statistics on the number of APPs put into use in domestic campuses, but it is certain that the number of APPs put into use will enter a rapid growth stage in the future, driven by the corresponding demand and guided by the national policy of encouraging students' independent innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>
